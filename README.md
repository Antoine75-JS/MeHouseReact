### Dependencies

Application runs in React with Redux as state manager. All css has been created from scratch unless specified (scss). The goal for me was to buid a fullstack application with no framework for react or css.

Other than the ones on the package.json, you'll need a mailjet account (free) in order to manage invitations emails.
